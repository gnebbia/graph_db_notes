# Graphs


A graph consists of a collection of nodes connected 
by directional relationships.

Graphs are easily extendable and expandable, in addition,
they are also very friendly to the human brain.

A node represents an entity, which is an abstraction
of the real world (e.g., customer, order, users).

A graph database is a database that uses graph structures
to represent and store data.
