# Neo4j Intro

Neo4j is a graph database with the following
main characteristics:
- ACID Graph DB;
- Implemented in Java;
- Features enterprise features with
  failover mechanisms or distirbuted computations;
- REST API which allows every technology to interact with it;


Neo4j supports different query languages, but the most common
and powerful one is **Cypher**.

Neo4j comes in two versions:
- Community (GPLv3);
- Enterprise;


## Plugin we may want to use

Neo4j has a published, open source Cypher library, Awesome Procedures
on Cypher (APOC) that contain many useful procedures you can call
from Cypher. Another Cypher library is the Graph Algorithms library,
shown here, that can help you to analyze data in your graphs. Graph
analytics are important because with Neo4j, the technology can expose
questions about the data that you never thought to ask. And finally, you
can use the GraphQL library (tree-based subset of a graph) to access a
Neo4j Database. These libraries are available as plug-ins to your Neo4j
development environment, but there are many other libraries that have
been written by users for accessing Neo4j.
